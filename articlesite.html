<h1>Unique and Bizarre Guns Used in the Ukraine</h1><br>
<p>In the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, a diverse array of weaponry has been employed by both Russian and Ukrainian forces, highlighting a unique blend of technological evolution and resourcefulness. Let’s examine the wide spectrum of firearms used in the conflict, from unconventional homemade weapons and vintage arms dating back to World War II, to the latest modern rifles making their initial combat appearances. By exploring these varied and sometimes extraordinary weapons, we gain insight into the adaptation and innovation that characterize this complex and evolving battlefield.</p>

<h2>AK-12: The New Generation of Kalashnikov Rifles</h2>

        <p>The AK-12, or "Avtomat Kalashnikova, 2012" (GRAU index 6P70), is a Russian-made, gas-operated assault rifle chambered for 5.45×39mm, developed by Kalashnikov Concern. It represents the fifth generation of Kalashnikov rifles. The AK-15, chambered in 7.62×39mm for the Russian military, and the AK-19, designed for international customers with a 5.56×45mm NATO chamber, are notable variants. Compact versions, the AK-12K and AK-15K, are also being developed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Initiated in 2011, the AK-12 project went through multiple prototypes to resolve various issues, eventually leading to the adoption of the improved AK-400 prototype, which became the final AK-12 model. Beyond Russia, the AK-12 and its variants are used in countries like Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Qatar, and Syria. In January 2022, the Directorate General of Defence Purchase in Bangladesh floated a tender for 2,000 AK-15s for the Bangladesh Army, signaling interest in expanding its use.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The rifle's first officially confirmed use in a conflict was during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where it was deployed by some Russian units. The AK-12, while relatively rare on the battlefield, is often found in the hands of elite Russian soldiers or Chechen forces, reflecting its status as a more advanced and specialized weapon within the Russian military. Despite its limited distribution, Ukrainian forces have managed to capture several AK-12s during the conflict. Notably, these captured rifles are often seen in videos filmed by Kyrylo Oleksiiovych Budanov, a Ukrainian military leader, who frequently has one in the background, as can be seen in the picture attached to this article. Additionally, there have been reports of the weapon being used by members of the Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces, who have incorporated these captured rifles into their own arsenals.</p>

<h2>From Toy Store to Trench: The QB57</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HmroyQ8.png" class="imgmiddle" height="50%" width="50%">
<br>

        <p>After two years of war, we've become accustomed to seeing very old and rusty weapons used by Russian forces—sometimes so worn out that they barely function. However, a few months ago, a video surfaced that caught everyone off guard, even those who regularly follow footage from the frontlines. In the video, a Ukrainian soldier films another Ukrainian soldier holding a weapon that once belonged to a Russian soldier, who doesn’t need it anymore. The gun was rusty and barely operational, with a makeshift sling made from wire or plastic rope. But the most unusual thing about this weapon wasn’t its condition—it was the gun itself.</p> <br>

     <p>This weapon was something unfamiliar to many, including myself. It had no magazine and featured a strange lever used for reloading. <a href="https://youtu.be/dJoAam1m9cE?t=278" target="_blank">Brandon Herrera</a>, in one of his videos where he reacts to unusual firearms, identified this weapon as a QB57—a Chinese-made single-shot pellet rifle. It's no wonder Russian morale is so low, with a lot of soldiers deserting rather than fighting; if this was the weapon I was expected to use, I’d probably do the same.</p><br>

     <p>The appearance of a QB57 on the battlefield highlights the desperate  nature of some equipment being used in this conflict. Originally designed as a low-powered air rifle for recreational shooting, the QB57 is far from suitable for military use. Its presence underscores the severe supply issues faced by some Russian soldiers, revealing deep-seated corruption within the Russian military. This corruption has led to a lack of proper supplies—from weapons to clothing—exposing significant logistical failures and the harsh realities faced by troops on the frontlines.</p><br>
