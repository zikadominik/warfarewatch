<h1>Overview of the Russo-Ukrainian War pre-2022 Russian invasion</h1><br>

<p>The Russo-Ukrainian War, which commenced in February 2014, began in the aftermath of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Dignity" target="_blank">Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity</a>. Following this revolution, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported pro-Russian separatists in their conflict with Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region. The initial eight years of conflict included naval skirmishes and cyberattacks. In February 2022, Russia escalated the conflict by launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marking the largest conflict in Europe since World War II. This escalation has triggered a severe refugee crisis and resulted in tens of thousands of casualties.</p>
<br>
<p>The conflict’s origins trace back to early 2014 when the Euromaidan protests led to the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. In the wake of these events, unrest erupted in eastern and southern Ukraine, while unmarked Russian troops took control of Crimea. Russia subsequently annexed Crimea following a controversial referendum. By April 2014, Russian-backed militants had captured towns in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, declaring the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), thus initiating the Donbas war. Russia covertly provided support to the separatists with personnel, tanks, and artillery, complicating Ukraine's efforts to regain control. Although the Minsk II agreements were signed in February 2015 to halt the conflict, they were never fully enforced. The Donbas war devolved into a protracted and violent stalemate, marked by numerous temporary ceasefires but no enduring peace or significant shifts in territorial control.</p>
<br>

<p>On February 24, 2022, Putin declared a "special military operation" aimed at "demilitarizing and denazifying" Ukraine, asserting that Russia had no intention of occupying the country. You can see Putin’s speach in video below this article. The subsequent invasion was met with widespread international condemnation, sanctions against Russia, and substantial humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. After fierce resistance, Russia abandoned its attempt to capture Kyiv in early April. From August 2022, Ukrainian forces began reclaiming territory in the northeast and south. In late September, Russia announced the annexation of four partially occupied provinces, a move condemned by the international community. Since then, both Russian and Ukrainian forces have made only limited territorial gains. Russia has conducted numerous deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians far from the frontlines. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has launched an investigation into war crimes and issued arrest warrants for Putin and other Russian officials. The invasion has also led to retaliatory attacks on Russian territory by Ukrainian and Ukrainian-aligned forces.</p>

<h1>A Brief Overview of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine</h1><br>
<p>On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a significant escalation in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, which had initially begun in 2014. This invasion, the largest European conflict since World War II, has resulted in hundreds of thousands of military casualties and tens of thousands of civilian deaths in Ukraine. By 2024, Russian forces were occupying approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory. Out of a population of 41 million, around 8 million Ukrainians were internally displaced, and over 8.2 million had fled the country by April 2023, marking the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.</p>
<br>
<p>In late 2021, Russia began amassing troops along Ukraine's borders, while denying any intent to invade. On February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a "special military operation" aimed at supporting the Russian-backed separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose forces had been engaged in conflict with Ukraine in the Donbas since 2014. Putin questioned Ukraine's sovereignty, falsely accusing its government of being controlled by neo-Nazis persecuting ethnic Russians, and claimed that Russia's objectives were to "demilitarize and denazify" Ukraine. The invasion began with airstrikes and a ground offensive on three fronts: from Belarus towards Kyiv in the north, from Crimea in the south, and from the Donbas towards Kharkiv in the east. Ukraine responded by enacting martial law, mobilizing its population, and cutting diplomatic ties with Russia.</p>
<br>
<p>By April 2022, Russian forces had withdrawn from the northern front, including areas near Kyiv, after facing logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance. However, on the southern and southeastern fronts, Russia captured Kherson in March and Mariupol in May after a brutal siege. Russia intensified its offensive in the Donbas and continued targeting military and civilian infrastructure, including Ukraine’s energy grid during the winter. In late 2022, Ukraine launched successful counteroffensives in the south and east. Following these advances, Russia declared the illegal annexation of four partially occupied regions. In November, Ukraine regained control of parts of Kherson Oblast, including the city of Kherson. In June 2023, Ukraine initiated another counteroffensive in the southeast, but by the year's end, it had only reclaimed small portions of territory.</p>
<br>
<p>The disruption to Ukrainian agriculture and shipping caused by the war contributed to a global food crisis, while the extensive environmental damage has been labeled as ecocide. Russian attacks on civilians have led to accusations of genocide. The invasion prompted widespread international condemnation, with the United Nations General Assembly passing a resolution in March 2022 demanding Russia's complete withdrawal. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to halt military operations, and Russia was expelled from the Council of Europe. Numerous countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus and provided significant humanitarian and military support to Ukraine. The Baltic states declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests against the war erupted globally, and within Russia, anti-war demonstrators faced mass arrests and increased media censorship. The International Criminal Court (ICC) launched investigations into war crimes, crimes against humanity, the abduction of Ukrainian children, and genocide against Ukrainians, issuing six arrest warrants, including for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, as well as for military officials Sergey Kobylash, Viktor Sokolov, Sergei Shoigu, and Valery Gerasimov.</p>
