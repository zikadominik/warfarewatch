<h1>Overview of the Russo-Ukrainian War pre-2022 Russian invasion</h1><br>

<p>The Russo-Ukrainian War, which commenced in February 2014, began in the aftermath of Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity. Following this revolution, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported pro-Russian separatists in their conflict with Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region. The initial eight years of conflict included naval skirmishes and cyberattacks. In February 2022, Russia escalated the conflict by launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marking the largest conflict in Europe since World War II. This escalation has triggered a severe refugee crisis and resulted in tens of thousands of casualties.</p>
<br>
<p>The conflict’s origins trace back to early 2014 when the Euromaidan protests led to the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. In the wake of these events, unrest erupted in eastern and southern Ukraine, while unmarked Russian troops took control of Crimea. Russia subsequently annexed Crimea following a controversial referendum. By April 2014, Russian-backed militants had captured towns in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, declaring the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), thus initiating the Donbas war. Russia covertly provided support to the separatists with personnel, tanks, and artillery, complicating Ukraine's efforts to regain control. Although the Minsk II agreements were signed in February 2015 to halt the conflict, they were never fully enforced. The Donbas war devolved into a protracted and violent stalemate, marked by numerous temporary ceasefires but no enduring peace or significant shifts in territorial control.</p>
<br>
<p>In 2021, Russia began a substantial military buildup near Ukraine’s borders, including in Belarus. Despite official denials of an impending attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed irredentist sentiments, denied Ukraine’s sovereignty, and demanded that Ukraine be excluded from NATO. In early 2022, Russia officially recognized the DPR and LPR as independent entities.</p>
<br>
<p>On February 24, 2022, Putin declared a "special military operation" aimed at "demilitarizing and denazifying" Ukraine, asserting that Russia had no intention of occupying the country. You can see Putin’s speach in video below this article. The subsequent invasion was met with widespread international condemnation, sanctions against Russia, and substantial humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. After fierce resistance, Russia abandoned its attempt to capture Kyiv in early April. From August 2022, Ukrainian forces began reclaiming territory in the northeast and south. In late September, Russia announced the annexation of four partially occupied provinces, a move condemned by the international community. Since then, both Russian and Ukrainian forces have made only limited territorial gains. Russia has conducted numerous deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians far from the frontlines. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has launched an investigation into war crimes and issued arrest warrants for Putin and other Russian officials. The invasion has also led to retaliatory attacks on Russian territory by Ukrainian and Ukrainian-aligned forces.</p>
